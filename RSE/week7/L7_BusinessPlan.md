Company Description
Our goal is to make bold streetwear for everyday use that helps people show who they are with confidence, creativity, and being true to themselves. We are sell shirts and hoodies to teenage kids, our location is in Richmond CA

Market Analysis
Before we start making the clothing we will put out a survey to see what they like and try to make what they want into a type of brand 

Competitor Analysis
Our brand will stand out to any other clothing brand because there outfits doesn't have a message like ours will. That is also a strength and every outfit will have a different message 

Marketing Plan
Our shirts will be $80 and our hoodies will be $120. To sell out clothing im going to have a famous person wear it and promoting it, people will see that and might wanna wear it to even when they hear the stories 

Management Team
I would be in charge plus I do all the delvering to and  it won't be that big of a team when it starts but when we get more money we will have different jobs for people. 

Financial Plan
If I sell one hoodie and one shirt every day I would make $200 but if I sell it for a year everyday I would make $73,000 and for 5 I will make $365,000
