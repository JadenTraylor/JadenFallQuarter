What is the MDA framework? What are its parts? Define each.
MDA stands for Mechanics which is a deck of coloerd cards that also has action cards. It also means Dynamics which is how you play the game like trying to give someone more cards. The last ting stands for is Aesthetics which is the emotional respones like if someone gets mad or happy during the game.

Mechanics - What rule/mechanic did your modify in your game? 
My rule was to end the game when the stack is gone and whoever has less wins and I will had more plus cards then the number cards to make sure it's more chances for you to draw cards.

Dynamics - How does the gameplay of your modded game differ from that original version?
now you have to staigize to get rid of cards and to make people draw cards 

How much does your modification change how the game feels to plays? What emotions change in players between both versions?
It chnages it becasue for one the game coukd be more quicker and fun. My new veriosn won't chnage the emotions because it's always gonna be a game to get you happy or upset.
